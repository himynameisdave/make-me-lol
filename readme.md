### make-me-lol

A command-line tool to make you laugh. Because who doesn't like to laugh, amirite? :stuck_out_tongue: All ya gotta do is type the command and it opens a random funny picture, gif or video from Reddit.

**Install**

```
npm i -g make-me-lol

You gotta have at least `node v4.0.0` for this to work, cause it's pretty ES6exy with it's use of [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and all.

Dead simple all you gotta do is run:

```

```

```
-h, --help     output usage information
